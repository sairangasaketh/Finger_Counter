🤖 Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV & Mediapipe
📌 Overview
This is a simple real-time hand gesture recognition project that detects and tracks hands using Mediapipe and OpenCV. It counts the number of fingers you are holding up and displays it on the screen.

🔥 Features
✔️ Detects hands in real-time using your webcam
✔️ Tracks hand landmarks and identifies fingers
✔️ Displays the number of fingers held up
✔️ Works with just Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe

📦 Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
🚀 How to Run
1️⃣ Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-recognition.git
cd hand-gesture-recognition
2️⃣ Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python hand_gesture.py
3️⃣ Show your hand in front of the camera and see it recognize the number of fingers you're holding up!
4️⃣ Press 'q' to exit.

📸 Demo
(You can add a GIF or image showing the detection in action.)

🛠️ How It Works
Uses Mediapipe Hands to detect and track hand landmarks.
OpenCV captures and processes the webcam feed.
The program analyzes hand landmark positions to determine the number of extended fingers.
🎮 Controls
🔹 Show your hand → Detects fingers
🔹 Press 'q' → Exit
